# Go Networking

This repository is a collection of Network Programming APIs or simply the ideas that I found interesting. It is a summary of what I know, as well as what I think I should reflect more upon.

The files are commented as thoroughly as possible. It ranges from simple Client queries or Server responses, to ideas about security of data through means of Data Integrity, Key Encryptions, TLS and all those generic topics.
